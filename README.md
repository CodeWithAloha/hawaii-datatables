HSPLS Serials Database
=================

The purpose of this website is to make Hawaii Public Library Serials Database more accessible and searchable.

Code for Hawaii is trying to aggregate all these data repositories into this
[Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ugRl6rdtIQMODwvTJXMnoXT4pd8vt4qewvWQ8kxdNtk).

We're using [DataTables](https://github.com/DataTables/DataTables) to visualize
the spreadsheet data and [TableTop](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) to
feed the data into the website from the spreadsheet.
